Understanding what impacts our planet's temperature changes over time is vital for understanding the dynamics of climate change. 

The goal of our project is to analyze the relationship between rising greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global temperatures. 


This project dives into historical temperature records to uncover trends and patterns, using data from FAO, NASA and ‘Our World In Data”.

We want to understand how global warming has evolved over centuries and decades. We'll start by carefully looking at temperature data, going from the past to the present. Through detailed analysis and visualisation, we'll reveal how temperatures have changed across different parts of the world and over time.

Using data from FAO, NASA and ‘Our World In Data”, This project explores historical temperature records to try to uncover trends and patterns. We will highlight this data exploration in further detail in the next steps.
